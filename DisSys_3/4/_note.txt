Question:
  Using Python multicast, write a client that sends out 10
  messages to a multicast group and another client that
  receives the messages. Give a few tests to see if all
  messages were correctly received.

Answer:
  Sender will send 4 test cases, each sending words of a verse
  from the song "Never Gonna Give You Up". It seems that the receiver
  received all the messages in order.
